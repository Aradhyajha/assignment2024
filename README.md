Role Based Access Control (In Development)

This is a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) application built using Node.js, Express, Passport.js, and more. It serves as a foundation for projects requiring user authentication and authorization.

For authentication, it currently supports email and password, but additional options like OAuth/OAuth2.0 integrations (e.g., Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.) can be easily added.

The application is structured based on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern for better scalability and maintainability.

Mongoose is used as the ORM to interact with MongoDB, while Passport.js handles local authentication with email and password.

The application is nearly production-ready.
